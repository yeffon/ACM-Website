          <img class="col-4 contentNetwork colM-1 " src="imgs/network.png" alt="">

          <p>Networking is defined as "the construction, design ans use of a computer netowrk, including the
        	physical (cabling, hub, switch, router, server, and so forth)." Understanding this, we have focused the
        	Networking portion of our club to preparing students for career readyness. Members will be taught the basics
        	of setting up LANs, WLANs, personal servers, cloud devices, router configurations, an introduction to CISCO
        	switches and many more topics!
          </p>

          <h1>What's New??</h1>
           <p>Recently, Our ACM Networking team went to a regional contest in Rochester NY. The contest was
      		 designed so that members had 24 hours to setup and design an interactive minecraft server given no prior
      		 knowlege or experience. Alfred State took 2nd out of a whopping 37 teams that competed.
      		 </p>
      		 <p>The ACM team also got a taste of real world experience when they went to Alfred-Almond central schools
      		 and helped setup the schools wireless netowrk. They spend the better portion of a week working closely and
      		 assisting the IT professionals at the school tasked with installing countless routers, server hubs, switches
      		 firewalls and LANS.
      		 </p>
      		 <p>On December 30th, our entire ACM club will be flying out to Orlando Florida to assist in repairing the
      		 computer necesssities destroyed by the recent hurricanes. We will be staying just south of Miami and driving to
      		 the affected areas every day. We will be assisting the local networking/cable companies restore internet
      		 access to several thousand people while they recover and recouperate from the terrible disaster that struck them this
      		 year.
      		 </p>
      		 <h1>Interested??</h1>
      		 <p>If you are interested in being apart of ACM, please check the contact us tab above. The networking portion of the club, meets
