          <h1>What is ACM?</h1>
          <p>Associates of Computer Machinery at Alfred State is an open club to
            those who are comitted to expanding their knowledge in the areas of computing.
            We tend to focus on the three areas of Programming, Web Development,
            and Networking, although we do touch on other areas very often.</p>

          <p>The club does take several optional trips during the year. This year
            we will be going to Microsoft Studios located in New York City. There we
            will be getting some hands on experience dealing with programming and
            looking into their networking department. Later this year we are going
            to be taking a trip to Cincinnati Ohio where we will be spending some
            time with SONY inc. We will be spending time with teir computer engineering
            department watching their day to day activites. We plan on scheduling 3
            other trips this year to gain even more hands on experience andgive our
            students more of an idea about life outside school.</p>

            <h2>Interested?</h2>

            <p>If you are interedsted in becoming a part of our club, feel free to
